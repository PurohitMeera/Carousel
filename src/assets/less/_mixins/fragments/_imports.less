/* Import the Clearless library */
//we want to import clearless one by one, not all are needed:

@import (once) "settings";
@import (once) "../../clearless/typography";
@import (once) "../../clearless/resets";
@import (once) "../../clearless/helpers";
// @import (once) "../../../vendor/less/clearless/sprites";
@import (once) "../../clearless/icons";
@import (once) "../../clearless/arrows";
@import (once) "grids";

//Clearless settings:
@using-modernizr: true;     // whether or not modernizer feature-detection classes are being used
@disable-filters: false;    // whether or not to disable MS-specific 'filter' properties (can make IE slow!)

//the generated LESS file import.
@import (once) '../../generated/sprites.less';
